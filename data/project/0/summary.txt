I developed this app with a goal to make a simple to use mobile reminder with minimal but necessary functions. There are a number of reminder apps, but some provide a variety of functions that become overhead for users who only perform simple tasks. I tried to keep only the necessary elements, for example, the create task button, the task names and reminders, on the interface and make tasks like creating a new reminder easy to accomplish.
