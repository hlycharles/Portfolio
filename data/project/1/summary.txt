This is one of the projects I did in my Distributed Systems class at Carnegie Mellon. The idea is to use RPC to build a key value database that can have multiple data stores and servers. Each server provides a RPC interface that listens to client requests. Additionally, each server also spawns an accompanying libstore instance that connect to storage servers. Upon receiving a client request, the server translates the request into database operations and the libstore instance will route those requests to corresponding storage servers via RPC. In the end, each storage server first verifies it is the right server to handle the request. If so, it then processes the request and completes the operation. All responses in the system are also handled as RPC call parameters.
