I developed this project as part of my Independent Study in CS Pedagogy course during my sophomore year. The goal is to provide an interactive online tutorial for CS students to learn basic CS concepts, for example, operator precedence and recursion. The project is completed with a team of 3. It was a fun experience as we got the freedom to explore the design space and come up with a solution have both tutorials and practice problems.
