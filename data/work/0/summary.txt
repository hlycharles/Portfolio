I really enjoy my experience at Kitturlab. I get the chance to work on an app that deals with a lot of user information and database operations. We are always looking for new features and at the same time fix existing bugs that hinder user experiences. Besides software, I also participate in some design and prototype meetings, which facilitate my ideation and prototyping skills.
