The entire Remitly experience was amazing. The company has a great environment. Everyone is passionate about their work and what the company is aiming to achieve. People are also friendly and open for discussions at any time. This was my first time developing a large scale front end project. I learned a lot of new technologies. The internship also provided a great chance for me to learn team communication through stand ups and design reviews.
