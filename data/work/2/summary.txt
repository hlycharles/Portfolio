I worked with C++ and OpenCV to develop a vehicle and pedestrian tracking system. Both systems support counting. The vehicle system supports vehicle categorization through SVM and the pedestrian tracking system supports waiting time estimation at intersections. This research was a great opportunity to learn computer vision and machine learning basics. I really appreciate how my advisor, Bernardo Pires, provided invaluable guidance throughout my research.
